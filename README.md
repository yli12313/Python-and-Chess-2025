# Project Title
Bobby Fisher + Chess + Python: Mastering the Sicilian Defense!

# Project Abstract
Chess has made a resounding resurgence in the 2020s and it’s a pastime that many Americans and citizens of the World enjoy. For a novice or for someone who’s getting back into the game, how does one improve his or her game? Analyzing games with Python off course! The Sicilian Defense is one of the most powerful and rudimentary defenses in all of Chess. Utilizing a Python Jupyter Notebook that examines the best games played by American Chess Grandmaster **Bobby Fisher** where he plays the Sicilian Defense, this talk will shed light into how a Chess player can use Python to extract best practices from the G.O.A.T.’s (Greatest of All Time) games played at scale! Specifically, every single Bobby Fischer Sicilian Defense game in .pgn will be downloaded, the game replayed with the Python chess library python-chess, analyzed with python-chess, and annotated for the principles. By the end of the talk, the audience will know how to practically deploy the Sicilian Defense in a game of Chess!
